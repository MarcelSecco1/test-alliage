## Getting Started

Welcome to my test at Alliage.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The project is dependency:

- `JDK`: openjdk 11.0.22 2024-01-16
